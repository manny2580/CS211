# PA3: Bomb Lab

This is a 6-phase binary bomb written in Assembly that had to be defused by giving each phase the correct input string.

There are 2 binary bombs in this folder:

bomb: Practice bomb, not fully defused

bomb92: My uniquely generated bomb, which was fully defused and submitted for a grade. Solutions are found in /bomb92/mysolutions.txt.
